		<h1>Hello</h1>
		<h2>My name is Jenn Jackson.</h2>
		
		<p>
		
			I received a certificate in computer science at Northwest State Community College in Archbold, OH. I then
			went on to receive my Bachelor of Science in Human Development and Family Science at The Ohio State University
			in Columbus, OH. After taking some time off to determine what I want to do, I have decided that I would like to
			further my understanding of computer science and software development.
